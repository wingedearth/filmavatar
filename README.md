#FILM AVATAR

###Field of the Application
With the replacement of free over-the-air broadcast television by 
subscription-based over-the-top (OTT) content (e.g. via Hulu,
Netflix, Amazon Video, etc.) and pay-per-download options (e.g. iTunes),
there is a need for curated, ad-free premium free video content available 
to the public. "The introduction of the first, legitimate Web-based 
television services happened in 2015. These new options stream live 
television channels. They include Sling TV from Dish Network and Vue 
on Sony's PlayStation game console."

While "cord-cutting" users benefit from greater access to content
and on-demand viewing, what's missing from the new paradigm is:

1) Local curators, and
2) Free videos

In the past, both of these functions were carried out by public
broadcasting stations, each of whom operates independently in each
community throughout the United States to select and curate
television content for free public broadcast based on each station's
relationship with its local community. To a lesser extent, affiliates 
of national TV networks would also provide certain content with a 
local emphasis via locally produced news programs.

In 2012, a company called Aereo attempted to solve the problem by
extending local broadcast reception to ideally located antennae that
members of the public could lease in order to stream can time-shift
video content for viewing at home.

Broadcasters did not like Aereo's solution, because it was outside
of the rigidly regulated telecommunications standards that allowed
broadcasters and copyright owners to reap the benefits of
"retransmission royalties" from cable companies, who have 
distributed the majority of television content for decades. After
Aereo's defeat in the Supreme Court, the public is left with few 
options for large amounts of free video content curated by their
communities.

Sites like YouTube.com offer certain solutions, but are unfortunately
burdened by a reliance on popularity, advertisements, and
a lack of a full station's worth of premium content through a single 
portal.
